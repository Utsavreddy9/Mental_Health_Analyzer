# Mental_Health_Analyzer


A machine learning and NLP-based project designed to detect signs of mental health issues (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress) in user-generated messages from chat platforms or online forums. The system uses sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and classification techniques to flag potentially concerning messages. It aims to support early identification and intervention by analyzing text for emotional tone, negative sentiment patterns, and linguistic markers of distress.

Tools/Libraries: Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Regex

Techniques: Sentiment polarity classification, TF-IDF, supervised learning (e.g., Logistic Regression or SVM), threshold-based alert system

Dataset: Publicly available mental health-related chat/forum datasets (e.g., Reddit, CLPsych)
